First Paragraph: Overall description, general overview:
A basic time series that shows what this model output looks like
verbally describe what happens in the simulations
Mention how many simulations actually stabilize (as percentage) for each experiment


#CODE ELIMINATE ALL DATA WHERE NOTHING STABILIZES


Second Paragraph: Number of extinctions
Bar plot for 3 experiments and percent extinction error bar variance: First one is percent of extinctions among all species (not nodes i think), second is extinction among fish only
just make sure i talk about the cool stuff i emailed



#CODE ELIMINATE ALL DATA WHERE FISH DONT STABILIZE



Third Paragraph: Stability -> Coefficient variation (CV)
Start with stability of total ecosystem, finish with stability of fish only (one or two paragraphs)
Fish to total biomass ratios for each experiment



End paragraph: Von-Bertalanffy
PROVE THAT FISH LIFE HISTORIES LOOK REALISTIC. I WANT TO CONVINCE THE READER THAT THESE ARE REAL FISH TOTALLY NOT MADE UP
coefficient of variation plot (indep) against weight_\infty (dependent) also biomass against weight_\infty (for both fish and total so four panel plot!)

ask anna about how to save results
